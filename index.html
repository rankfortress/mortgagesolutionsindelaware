	Your future self will thank you for opting to go with a mortgage, even if it’s not just because of the tax benefits. Not only can you give yourself more financial flexibility in terms of how much money is allocated toward your home vs other investments than what there would be without an equity stake, but many homeowners get some relief from their taxes by itemizing deductions instead taking the standard deduction.
	
	The sooner you start saving for your future goals, the better off you’ll be when it comes time to retire! If you’re considering getting a mortgage, talk to your lender about how much money you might need and what type of programs they have available so that you can make informed decisions about which program is best for your situation.
